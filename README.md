# Calculator
This is a simple web app completely built using React and Redux. It currently has two types of calculators:
- Standard Calculator
- Currency Converter

Routing is used to display the multiple calculators within the same layout.


## Standard Calculator
The standard calulator has basic functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. This besides calculating, also displays the ongoing calculation till the time you finally press `equals to` operator. You can chain multiple operations like `10-2+25*3/2`

## Currency Converter
The Currency Converter, as the name suggests, shows the converted value of a particular currency in a different currency.
